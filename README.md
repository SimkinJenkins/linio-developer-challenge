# Linio Developer Challenge

Challenge - iOS Developer

The objective is to create the favorites screen using data from a remote .json file.

# Description:

- The screen is composed of a header with the screen name (Favoritos) and two different sections.
- The first section displays a snapshot of each collection created by the user. Each snapshot should display the images for the 3 first products from each collection, the collection name and the quantity of items in that collection.
- The second section must display all products, from all collections.
- Each cell, in this section, should display the product image and the badges representing the product attributes:
- Linio Plus badge if product is Linio Plus Level 1 (ndIc30PlusSquare icon image)
- Linio Plus 48 if product is Linio Plus Level 2 (ndIc30Plus48Square icon image)
- Refurbished if product’s condition type is refurbished (ndIc30RefurbishedSquare icon image)
- New if product’s condition type is new (ndIc30NewSquare icon image)
- Airplane if product is imported (ndIc30InternationalSquare icon image)
- Free shipping truck if product has free shipping (ndIc30FreeShippingSquare icon image)
- You don't have to create the navigation bar at the bottom. The objective is to create the favorites screen using data from a remote .json file.

# Rules:

- The code must be written in Swift and the app must be compatible with iOS 9.0+.
- We will evaluate UX/design, code quality and project organization (MVVM is expected - Clean Architecture is an extra).
