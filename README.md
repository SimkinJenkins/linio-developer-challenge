# Description:

- The screen is composed of a header with the screen name (Favoritos) and two different sections.
- The first section displays a snapshot of each collection created by the user. Each snapshot should display the images for the 3 first products from each collection, the collection name and the quantity of items in that collection.

·         The second section must display all products, from all collections.

·         Each cell, in this section, should display the product image and the badges representing the product attributes:

·         Linio Plus badge if product is Linio Plus Level 1 (ndIc30PlusSquare icon image)

·         Linio Plus 48 if product is Linio Plus Level 2 (ndIc30Plus48Square icon image)

·         Refurbished if product’s condition type is refurbished (ndIc30RefurbishedSquare icon image)

·         New if product’s condition type is new (ndIc30NewSquare icon image)

·         Airplane if product is imported (ndIc30InternationalSquare icon image)

·         Free shipping truck if product has free shipping (ndIc30FreeShippingSquare icon image)

·         You don't have to create the navigation bar at the bottom. The objective is to create the favorites screen using data from a remote .json file.
